AndroidRover
============

A significant update to my Android Car project. This is driven with mecanum wheels, so it can go sideways!

A video of it driving around can be found here: http://youtu.be/w5IfFvbPZ24

The rover chassis, motor controller board, and the IOIO to control it all came from Sparkfun Electronics. The rest of the parts from Lowe's and Radio Shack.

Just upgraded to the new IOIO-OTG and so far it has been really awesome!
